Direction guard (2026-07-06): the GTSF DGG development is migrating to
the mediated relation (`MediatedNarrowing`, `⊒ᵐ`) — see the
"Migration step" entries in `GTSF/proof/SeparatedStoresDGGChecklist.md`.
The two retired surfaces and their proof stacks are scheduled for
deletion once the port lands; do NOT fill their holes or discharge
their postulates:
  - shared-store surface: `TermNarrowing` with `proof/Catchup.agda`,
    `proof/DynamicGradualGuarantee.agda`,
    `proof/TermSubstitutionNarrowing.agda`,
    `proof/LeftSealNarrowingInversion.agda`,
    `proof/RightSealInversion2.agda`;
  - two-store surface: `TermNarrowingSeparated` with
    `proof/SimBetaSeparated.agda` (postulate),
    `proof/LeftChangeNarrowingSeparated.agda` (postulate family),
    `proof/CatchupSeparated.agda` (`catchup-lemmaˡ` — but its
    store-change operations are imported by the mediated surface and
    stay), `proof/DGGBeta*Separated.agda`,
    `proof/InnerStepCastSeparated.agda`,
    `proof/LeftNuWideningSeparated.agda`,
    `proof/DynamicGradualGuaranteeSeparated.agda`.
New proof work goes to the `⊒ᵐ` ports (`proof/*Mediated.agda`,
`proof/MediationProperties.agda`).

[ ] Discharge the mediated plumbing holes in
    `GTSF/proof/MediationProperties.agda` (left by PR #48, step 2 of
    the mediated migration, plus one left over from step 1).  All
    four are named `{! !}` holes; background is in the "Migration
    step 2 progress" and "Migration step 3" entries of
    `GTSF/proof/SeparatedStoresDGGChecklist.md`.  (A fifth hole,
    `medCo-dualʷ`, was deleted along with `MedCo` itself by the ⨟ˡ
    record simplification — migration step 3 — as was
    `med-narrowing-witness`.)
    1. `left-changes-narrowingˡ` — one-store left-store transport of
       a narrowing judgment across `StoreChanges`.  Build from the
       `applyCoercion-typing` shapes (proof/NuPreservation.agda) plus
       `renameⁿ` witness renaming.  Open design point recorded in the
       checklist: iterating needs StoreWfAt at each intermediate
       step, but bare `StoreChanges` does not carry wf of the bound
       types — either thread a wf-chain invariant or drop the wf
       requirement from the underlying weakening lemmas.
    2. `narrowing-dual¹-applyCoercions` — the dual raw of a narrowing
       is determined by the raw and commutes with the store-change
       shifts (a narrowing sibling of `dualʷ-raw-determined`, plus
       dual/rename commutation generalized over the action env).
    3. `left-changes-term-narrowingᵐ` — the ⊒ᵐ replacement of the old
       postulated `left-change-term-narrowing`: structural induction
       over `MediatedNarrowing._∣_∣_∣_⊢_⊒_∶_⦂_⊒ᵐ_` with the index
       raw untouched; `left-changes-transportᵐ` handles the coercion
       fields, binder cases shift the correspondence
       (`⇑ᶜorr`/`⇑ᵍᶜ`-style, cf. `medTy-applyLeftChanges` and
       `mv-lockstep`).
    4. `right-store-shift-weakening` (inside
       `right-alloc-transportᵐ`, left over from step 1) — ordinary
       one-store weakening of the home typing under a right-store
       allocation, modulo the `rightStore-⇑ʳᶜorr` reindexing; base
       language, independent of mediation (see the comment at the
       hole).
    Constraints: no new postulates without explicit approval; holes
    OK; `make -C GTSF check` green before commit; commit + PR at the
    end.  After these, the next migration step is moving the DGG
    proof stack (`DGGBeta*`, `InnerStepCastSeparated`, the main
    theorem) onto ⊒ᵐ and deleting `TermNarrowingSeparated`.

[ ] Prove `catchup-lemmaᵐ` in `GTSF/proof/CatchupMediated.agda`: the
    statement is settled (PR #48's `sim-betaᵐ` already consumes it)
    but all eight clauses are `{! ? !}` holes.  Port the proof shape
    from the shared-store `proof/Catchup.agda` `catchup-lemma`
    (per-frame case analysis), restated over `⊒ᵐ` with left store
    changes accumulated as in `sim-betaᵐ`.  Same constraints as
    above.

[ ] Discharge the approved postulate `term-substitution-narrowingᵐ`
    in `GTSF/proof/SimBetaMediated.agda` (approved 2026-07-06): the
    substitution metatheory of the mediated term relation.  This is
    the ⊒ᵐ analogue of the open substitution lemma of the old
    surfaces; expect it to be its own sizable development
    (term-level substitution vs. the relation's context discipline).

[ ] Update `GTSF/NarrowWidenComposition.agda` so proof-level
    composition `_⨟ⁿ_` / `_⨟ʷ_` concludes directly about the raw
    composition operator `_⨟_` instead of returning an existential
    coercion.  Use the fuel monotonicity/sufficiency lemmas around
    `composeᶜ` in `GTSF/Coercions.agda` (`seq-fuel≤`,
    `arrow-left-fuel≤`, ...).  (File references corrected by the
    2026-07-06 audit; the operators were never in
    `proof/NarrowWidenProperties.agda`.)  Note: today's consumers are
    the retired shared-store/two-store surfaces only, and the
    mediated composition records (`⨟ʳ`/`⨟ˡ`) take an arbitrary
    composite raw, so the existential form is already usable there —
    this is base-language cleanup, not migration-blocking.

[B] Finish the proof of sim-left-beta in
    PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/DGGSim.agda
    The proof structure (cases, recursion) should be
    similar to sim-beta in 
    GTLC/agda/proof/DynamicGradualGuaranteeCore.agda
    The cases involving features also in GTLC should be easy, follow
    the reasoning from the GTLC proof of sim-beta.
    The proof may require new cases involving the new features of PolyUpDown,
    which may be more difficult. Make an attempt at those but leave a hole
    if you can't finish.

  Blocker: Agda coverage/type refinement is currently blocked on dependent pattern splitting for this goal: it reports an unresolved possible `⊑⦂∀-ν` branch for `sim-left-beta` (around lines 323-340) even with a catch-all, and the `⊑upL`/`⊑downL` branches need an auxiliary cast-argument catch-up lemma (GTLC `cast-left-id-val` analogue) to turn casted arguments into values while preserving imprecision before recursive use of `sim-left-beta`.

[B] Implement the "Next likely move" at the bottom of the file
    PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/plan.md

  Blocker: codex exec exceeded timeout of 600.0 seconds.

[B] Port the GTLC `cast-left-id-val` lemma over to 
    in PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/DGGSim.agda
    Note that you must flip from ⊑ as precision to ⊑ as imprecision.

  Blocker: GTLC’s lemma crucially depends on an explicit cast-precision premise (`c ⊑ id`) and its inversion/decomposition (e.g., extracting arrow sub-cast relations). In `extrinsic-inst` PolyUpDown, the simulation relation is flipped to imprecision and split across `⊑upL`/`⊑downL` with only cast typing judgments (`⊢ u ⦂ A ⊑ B`, `⊢ d ⦂ A ⊒ B`), not a direct cast-precision relation to `id`. A correct port therefore needs new bridge/inversion lemmas connecting these cast typings to an id-like decomposition (for both `Up` and `Down`) before the value catch-up proof can be completed. That bridge is currently missing, so the lemma cannot be completed soundly without adding that extra infrastructure first.

[B] Finish the proof of sim-left-beta in
    PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/DGGSim.agda
    The proof structure (cases, recursion) should be
    similar to sim-beta in 
    GTLC/agda/proof/DynamicGradualGuaranteeCore.agda
    The cases involving features also in GTLC should be easy, follow
    the reasoning from the GTLC proof of sim-beta.
    The proof may require new cases involving the new features of PolyUpDown,
    which may be more difficult. Make an attempt at those but leave a hole
    if you can't finish.

  Blocker: The remaining `⊑upL` and `⊑downL` `wt-↦` branches require a cast-argument catch-up lemma (GTLC-analogous to `cast-left-id-val`) to obtain a value from `W down p` / `W up p` and a corresponding precision witness before recursive `sim-left-beta` can proceed. That helper is not available in this file, so the proof cannot be completed here without introducing new supporting lemmas or postulates.

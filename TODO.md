[ ] In GTSF, prove compile-preserves-term-imprecision-typed
    in proof/CompileTermImprecision.agda
    You may need to prove some foundational lemmas about consistency and imprecision.
    Do not introduce new postulates.
    You are done when there are no holes in this theorem and in the helper lemmas that it uses.

[ ] In GTSF, investigate replacing the new compile-specific
    NuTermImprecision application constructors with a canonical maximal
    lower-bound proof for consistency casts.
    Background: consistency is currently an existential common lower bound:
      Δ ⊢ A ~ B = ∃[ C ] idᵢ Δ ⊢ C ⊑ A × idᵢ Δ ⊢ C ⊑ B
    and Compile.consistency-cast-plan uses the witness C supplied by that
    consistency proof.  In compile-preserves-term-imprecision-typed, the
    source and target sides may therefore insert casts through different
    lower witnesses C and C′.  The direct proof path then gets stuck needing
    coherence such as C ⊑ C′, but the arbitrary existential witnesses do not
    provide that.
    A feasible alternative proof likely needs:
      1. a canonical maximal-lower-bound selector for consistency;
      2. a selector-specific maximality property, not a general GLB theorem
         (GLBs do not exist for all consistent GTSF types);
      3. a canonical coherence corollary, saying if A ⊑ A′ and B ⊑ B′,
         then the selected MLB for A,B is imprecise to the selected MLB
         for A′,B′;
      4. a change to Compile.consistency-cast-plan so it casts through the
         canonical lower bound rather than the arbitrary existential witness;
      5. a rewrite of the application cases of
         proof/CompileTermImprecision.agda to use the existing cast
         imprecision constructors instead of the compile-specific
         NuTermImprecision constructors.
    Existing starting point: GTSF/proof/MaximalLowerBounds.agda already
    sketches much of this direction, including MaximalLowerBound,
    ComparableMaximalLowerBound, mlb-type, and choose-mlb.  However, the file
    currently does not type-check: it still contains stale occurrence-index
    assumptions for wf∀/∀ⁱ, and it has postulates including choose-mlbᶜ plus
    supporting spine lemmas.  Repairing this file means deriving occurrence
    evidence where ν needs it, not from wf∀, because WfTy.wf∀ no longer stores
    occurrence evidence.
    Important caveat: proving only "a maximal lower exists" is not enough if
    Compile.consistency-cast-plan keeps using arbitrary witnesses from _⊢_~_.
    Either compile must use the canonical lower, or one must additionally prove
    cast-plan coherence/normalization between arbitrary-witness plans and
    canonical plans.  The latter is probably not cheaper.
    Do not introduce new postulates.  Done when the canonical lower-bound
    infrastructure type-checks, Compile uses it for consistency casts, and
    compile-preserves-term-imprecision-typed no longer needs the
    compile-specific NuTermImprecision application constructors.

[B] Finish the proof of sim-left-beta in
    PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/DGGSim.agda
    The proof structure (cases, recursion) should be
    similar to sim-beta in 
    GTLC/agda/proof/DynamicGradualGuaranteeCore.agda
    The cases involving features also in GTLC should be easy, follow
    the reasoning from the GTLC proof of sim-beta.
    The proof may require new cases involving the new features of PolyUpDown,
    which may be more difficult. Make an attempt at those but leave a hole
    if you can't finish.

  Blocker: Agda coverage/type refinement is currently blocked on dependent pattern splitting for this goal: it reports an unresolved possible `⊑⦂∀-ν` branch for `sim-left-beta` (around lines 323-340) even with a catch-all, and the `⊑upL`/`⊑downL` branches need an auxiliary cast-argument catch-up lemma (GTLC `cast-left-id-val` analogue) to turn casted arguments into values while preserving imprecision before recursive use of `sim-left-beta`.

[B] Implement the "Next likely move" at the bottom of the file
    PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/plan.md

  Blocker: codex exec exceeded timeout of 600.0 seconds.

[B] Port the GTLC `cast-left-id-val` lemma over to 
    in PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/DGGSim.agda
    Note that you must flip from ⊑ as precision to ⊑ as imprecision.

  Blocker: GTLC’s lemma crucially depends on an explicit cast-precision premise (`c ⊑ id`) and its inversion/decomposition (e.g., extracting arrow sub-cast relations). In `extrinsic-inst` PolyUpDown, the simulation relation is flipped to imprecision and split across `⊑upL`/`⊑downL` with only cast typing judgments (`⊢ u ⦂ A ⊑ B`, `⊢ d ⦂ A ⊒ B`), not a direct cast-precision relation to `id`. A correct port therefore needs new bridge/inversion lemmas connecting these cast typings to an id-like decomposition (for both `Up` and `Down`) before the value catch-up proof can be completed. That bridge is currently missing, so the lemma cannot be completed soundly without adding that extra infrastructure first.

[B] Finish the proof of sim-left-beta in
    PolyUpDown/agda/extrinsic-inst/DGGSim.agda
    The proof structure (cases, recursion) should be
    similar to sim-beta in 
    GTLC/agda/proof/DynamicGradualGuaranteeCore.agda
    The cases involving features also in GTLC should be easy, follow
    the reasoning from the GTLC proof of sim-beta.
    The proof may require new cases involving the new features of PolyUpDown,
    which may be more difficult. Make an attempt at those but leave a hole
    if you can't finish.

  Blocker: The remaining `⊑upL` and `⊑downL` `wt-↦` branches require a cast-argument catch-up lemma (GTLC-analogous to `cast-left-id-val`) to obtain a value from `W down p` / `W up p` and a corresponding precision witness before recursive `sim-left-beta` can proceed. That helper is not available in this file, so the proof cannot be completed here without introducing new supporting lemmas or postulates.


## Obsolete items

Direction guard (2026-07-06): the GTSF DGG development is migrating to
the mediated relation (`MediatedNarrowing`, `⊒ᵐ`) — see the
"Migration step" entries in `GTSF/proof/SeparatedStoresDGGChecklist.md`.
The two retired surfaces and their proof stacks are scheduled for
deletion once the port lands; do NOT fill their holes or discharge
their postulates:
  - shared-store surface: `TermNarrowing` with `proof/Catchup.agda`,
    `proof/DynamicGradualGuarantee.agda`,
    `proof/TermSubstitutionNarrowing.agda`,
    `proof/LeftSealNarrowingInversion.agda`,
    `proof/RightSealInversion2.agda`;
  - two-store surface: `TermNarrowingSeparated` with
    `proof/SimBetaSeparated.agda` (postulate),
    `proof/LeftChangeNarrowingSeparated.agda` (postulate family),
    `proof/CatchupSeparated.agda` (`catchup-lemmaˡ` — but its
    store-change operations are imported by the mediated surface and
    stay), `proof/DGGBeta*Separated.agda`,
    `proof/InnerStepCastSeparated.agda`,
    `proof/LeftNuWideningSeparated.agda`,
    `proof/DynamicGradualGuaranteeSeparated.agda`.
New proof work goes to the `⊒ᵐ` ports (`proof/*Mediated.agda`,
`proof/MediationProperties.agda`).

[ ] DECIDE and finish `left-changes-term-narrowingᵐ`, now in
    `GTSF/proof/MediatedLeftInsertion.agda` (PR #60; checklist
    "Migration step 5").  The left-insertion machinery is built and
    hole-free (`LeftIns`/`StoreIns`, `insRen`/`insModeEnv`,
    `mv-insert`, `narrowing-insertᵐ`/`narrowing-insertˡ`, the
    `⨟ʳ`/`⨟ˡ` record transports, `typing-insertᵀ`), and twelve of the
    seventeen cases of `term-narrowing-insertᵐ` are proved.  The
    remaining five constructor cases are hole-bodied because the
    statement is FALSE for them as the relation stands.  The problems
    and the recommended fixes, in full:

    PROBLEM 1 — `ν⊒νᵗ` shares one raw three ways.  Its conclusion is
    `⊢ ν A N (⇑ᶜ p) ⊒ ν A′ N′ (⇑ᶜ p) ∶ p ⦂ B ⊒ᵐ B′`: the SAME `p`
    is the (home-typed, right-store) index and is embedded, shifted,
    in BOTH terms.  A left `bind` rewrites the left term by `⇑ᵗᵐ`,
    which renames its embedded copy to `⇑ᶜ (⇑ᶜ p)` (the ν-position
    coercion sits inside the binder, so `renameᵗᵐ` hits it with
    `extᵗ suc`), while the index and the right term keep `⇑ᶜ p`.
    No constructor relates the resulting pair: ν⊒νᵗ forces both
    embedded raws to equal `⇑ᶜ (index)`, and ⊒νᵗ (right-ν, left
    arbitrary) would need the SHIFTED WHOLE left ν-term related to
    the body `N′` — there is no left-only-ν introduction rule.
    Concrete counterexample: any ν⊒νᵗ node with `p = id (＇ β)` and
    `χs = bind X ∷ []`.
    RECOMMENDED FIX: stop sharing the left copy syntactically.
    Change the left term to `ν A N sₗ` where `sₗ` is its own
    left-world raw, carried with a left one-store typing premise
    `s⊒ˡ : η ∣ suc ΔL ∣ leftStore (matched zero (⇑ᵗ A) zero (⇑ᵗ A′)
    ∷ ⇑ᶜorr ρ) ⊢ sₗ ∶ C ⊒ Cₗ′` (exactly how cast+⊒ᵗ/cast-⊒ᵗ carry
    `s⊒ˡ`, so a left change renames `sₗ` together with the store it
    is typed against — `narrowing-insertˡ` already transports this),
    plus a side condition tying `sₗ` to the right/right-index copy
    `⇑ᶜ p`.  The tie's exact form should be settled from the
    consumer: the ν clauses of `catchup-lemmaᵐ`/`sim-betaᵐ` (still
    holes) will reveal what the post-allocation cast nodes need —
    the natural candidate is the pair of premises those cast nodes
    take (`s⊒ˡ` + a `⨟ˡ`-style glue for the left cast, `t⊒ʳ` + `⨟ʳ`
    for the right cast at `⇑ᶜ p`).  NOTE the mirror question will
    arise for RIGHT store changes (the right term's embedded copy vs
    a left-typed index) — design the tie once, symmetrically.

    PROBLEM 2 — `⊒Λᵗ` and `⊒⟨ν⟩ᵗ` embed the LEFT endpoint in
    left-invariant positions.  ⊒Λᵗ concludes
    `⊢ N ⊒ Λ V′ ∶ gen A p ⦂ A ⊒ᵐ (`∀ B)`: the index raw embeds the
    left endpoint `A`.  This is forced to be self-mediated: the ∶ᶜ
    premise's home typing uses `cast-gen`, whose source endpoint IS
    the raw's embedded type, so the package's mediated image `Aʳ`
    satisfies `Aʳ ≡ A`.  Under a left insertion the endpoint becomes
    `renameᵗ (insRen χs k) A` but the index must stay `gen A p` —
    underivable (counterexample: `N = ` x`, `A = ＇ 0`,
    `ρ = matched 0 ★ 0 ★ ∷ []`, `χs = bind X ∷ []`).  ⊒⟨ν⟩ᵗ has the
    same index AND embeds `gen A s` in the (left-invariant) RIGHT
    term.
    RECOMMENDED FIX (small and self-contained; do this one first):
    add an implicit `Aʳ` to both constructors and replace every
    embedded `A` by `Aʳ`: premise `ΔL ∣ ΔR ∣ ρ ⊢ gen Aʳ p ∶ᶜ A ⊒ᵐ
    `∀ B`, conclusion index `gen Aʳ p`, and in ⊒⟨ν⟩ᵗ right term
    `V′ ⟨ gen Aʳ s ⟩` (also better-typed: the right cast's source
    lives in the right world, which is exactly `Aʳ`).  No new field
    is needed — the ∶ᶜ package already contains `Σ[ Aʳ ] MedTy
    (MatchedVar ρ) A Aʳ`, and cast-gen pins the raw to it.  With
    this, both cases are provable by `narrowing-insertᵐ` (index and
    `Aʳ` untouched; `medTy-mapˡ` moves the mediation to the renamed
    endpoint) — the case bodies then mirror the proved ⊒νᵗ clause.
    Consumer sweep needed: construction sites currently instantiate
    with `Aʳ = A`; they need a self-mediation witness `MedTy
    (MatchedVar ρ) A A`, which holds when A's variables are
    lockstep-matched in ρ — add a small `medTy-refl`-style lemma for
    that (`med-var ∘ (proof that each var is self-matched)`).  Grep
    consumers: `MediatedNarrowing.agda` extractors (no change — they
    never inspect the embedded type), `proof/CatchupMediated.agda`
    (statement-level, holes), `proof/SimBetaMediated.agda` (pattern
    matches on gen-indexed nodes).

    PROBLEM 3 — `α⊒αᵗ`/`⊒αᵗ` and the `⊢•` typing rule anchor the
    store/correspondence HEAD.  Their conclusions live at
    `matched/right-only zero … ∷ ⇑ᶜorr ρ` (entry at position zero)
    and their `(⇑ᵗᵐ L) •` terms are typed by `⊢•`, which requires
    `Σ ≡ (zero , ⇑ᵗ A) ∷ ⟰ᵗ Σ₀`.  A depth-0 insertion (`li-zero`)
    puts the new left-only entry ABOVE both anchors, so the
    transported instance has a left-only head where the constructors
    demand matched/right-only — underivable.  Separately,
    `typing-insertᵀ`'s `⊢•` clause is blocked at ALL depths: `⊢•`
    shares Γ verbatim between its premise (at Δ₀) and conclusion (at
    suc Δ₀), so the transported premise wants Γ renamed by
    `insRen χs (k-1)` while the conclusion wants `insRen χs k`;
    these agree only on ⇑ᵗ-shifted entries, and only one binder
    deep.
    RECOMMENDED PATH: first study how `proof/NuPreservation.agda`
    carries `⊢•` typings across bind-emitting reduction steps — the
    language's own preservation proof must already resolve this
    anchoring (likely via the `No•`/`One•` discipline: a left `bind`
    is only emitted by ν-allocation, which happens when the ν body
    is a value, i.e. with no live `•` outside the allocating ν).
    Whatever invariant it uses is the premise to add.  Two concrete
    ways to state it: (i) a `No• M` premise on
    `left-changes-term-narrowingᵐ` (excludes `⊢•` nodes in the left
    typing derivations AND α⊒αᵗ/⊒αᵗ nodes, whose left terms are
    •-applications; `renameᵗᵐ-preserves-No•` threads it through the
    induction) — but check the DGG call sites can supply it, since
    compiled source ƛ-bodies may contain `(⇑ᵗᵐ L) •` from type
    application; or (ii) a recursive predicate `LeftStable :
    (derivation) → Set` defined by recursion on the relation (⊤ at
    the twelve good constructors, conjunction of sub-results; ⊥ at
    the five bad ones), taken as a premise and discharged by the
    DGG's runtime invariant.  Option (ii) also covers PROBLEM 1/2 if
    the reshapes are rejected, at the cost of pushing the burden to
    every DGG use site.

    NEXT STEPS, in order:
    1. jsiek decides: reshape ⊒Λᵗ/⊒⟨ν⟩ᵗ (recommended, low-risk) and
       ν⊒νᵗ (needs the tie design), vs the `LeftStable` premise
       route; and pick the `⊢•` invariant after reading
       NuPreservation.
    2. If reshaping: edit `MediatedNarrowing.agda`, sweep consumers
       (grep `⊒Λᵗ|⊒⟨ν⟩ᵗ|ν⊒νᵗ` in `GTSF/proof/*.agda`), add
       `medTy-refl` to `Mediation.agda`.
    3. Fill the five holes in `term-narrowing-insertᵐ` and the `⊢•`
       clause of `typing-insertᵀ` (all in
       `proof/MediatedLeftInsertion.agda`); the twelve proved cases
       and all machinery are reshape-agnostic and stay.
    4. `make -C GTSF check` green; commit + PR.
    Constraints: no new postulates without explicit approval; holes
    OK.  After this, the next migration step is moving the DGG proof
    stack (`DGGBeta*`, `InnerStepCastSeparated`, the main theorem)
    onto ⊒ᵐ and deleting `TermNarrowingSeparated`.

[ ] Prove `catchup-lemmaᵐ` in `GTSF/proof/CatchupMediated.agda`: the
    statement is settled (PR #48's `sim-betaᵐ` already consumes it)
    but all eight clauses are `{! ? !}` holes.  Port the proof shape
    from the shared-store `proof/Catchup.agda` `catchup-lemma`
    (per-frame case analysis), restated over `⊒ᵐ` with left store
    changes accumulated as in `sim-betaᵐ`.  Same constraints as
    above.

[ ] Discharge the approved postulate `term-substitution-narrowingᵐ`
    in `GTSF/proof/SimBetaMediated.agda` (approved 2026-07-06): the
    substitution metatheory of the mediated term relation.  This is
    the ⊒ᵐ analogue of the open substitution lemma of the old
    surfaces; expect it to be its own sizable development
    (term-level substitution vs. the relation's context discipline).

[ ] Update `GTSF/NarrowWidenComposition.agda` so proof-level
    composition `_⨟ⁿ_` / `_⨟ʷ_` concludes directly about the raw
    composition operator `_⨟_` instead of returning an existential
    coercion.  Use the fuel monotonicity/sufficiency lemmas around
    `composeᶜ` in `GTSF/Coercions.agda` (`seq-fuel≤`,
    `arrow-left-fuel≤`, ...).  (File references corrected by the
    2026-07-06 audit; the operators were never in
    `proof/NarrowWidenProperties.agda`.)  Note: today's consumers are
    the retired shared-store/two-store surfaces only, and the
    mediated composition records (`⨟ʳ`/`⨟ˡ`) take an arbitrary
    composite raw, so the existential form is already usable there —
    this is base-language cleanup, not migration-blocking.
